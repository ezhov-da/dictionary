# dictionary

This app is a dictionary for easy vocabulary learning.

When you start the **dictionary-informant** of the mouse, a small window appears, which shows the English word and the translation every 30 seconds.
Thus, when working at a computer, you can replenish your vocabulary.

At the moment, applications are still in development.

The instructions will be updated as the application develops.
